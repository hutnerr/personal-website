                    <p>This was a group Web Development project. In this project, we created a website whose purpose was to help
                        users find recipes they could make using the ingredients they had on deck using the <a
                        href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular API</a>. My primary role in this
                        project was working with the backend to integrate the recipe API and database.</p>
                    <p>You can view the website <a
                        href="https://343f24.github.io/343f24-final-project-pantry-panic/search_by_ingredients.html">here</a>.
                        However, the project is currently not functional due to a cancellation of the API service.</p>

                    <p>The final product was a web application that what food items a user had in their "Pantry", and
                        would allow them to simply click a button to perform a search to see numerous recipes they
                        could've
                        made with what they had on deck.</p>
                    <p>The website was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a clean and modern interface. The main features of the website included: </p>

                        <li>Pantry feature to manage and search using ingredients set</li>

                <p>This was my first time using an API and I learned a lot about how to work with them effectively. I gained
                valuable experience in making API calls, handling responses, and integrating data into a web
                application.</p>
                <p>Some key takeaways include:</p>
                <ul class="arrowed-list">
                    <li>APIs are very powerful tools and very useful overall</li>
                    <li>Effective communication mitigates a majority of issues that arise in group projects</li>
                    <li>Understanding the importance of user experience and accessibility in web design</li>
                    <li>Experience working with JavaScript and asynchronous programming</li>
