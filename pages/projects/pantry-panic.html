            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This was a group Web Development project. In this project, we created a website whose purpose was to help
                users find recipes they could make using the ingredients they had on deck using the <a
                    href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular API</a>. My primary role in this
                project was working with the backend to integrate the recipe API and database.</p>
            <p>You can view the website <a
                    href="https://343f24.github.io/343f24-final-project-pantry-panic/search_by_ingredients.html">here</a>.
                However, the project is currently not functional due to a cancellation of the API service.</p>

            <h2>The Product</h2>
            <div class="grid-container">
                <div class="content-left">
                    <p>The final product was a web application that what food items a user had in their "Pantry", and
                        would allow them to simply click a button to perform a search to see numerous recipes they
                        could've
                        made with what they had on deck.</p>
                    <p>
                        The website was designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a clean and modern
                        interface. The main features of the website included:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pantry feature to manage and search using ingredients set</li>
                        <li>Ingredient-based recipe search</li>
                        <li>Save favorite recipes using local storage</li>
                        <li>View recipe details and instructions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Some other features include the ability to export/import your favorite recipes and media queries
                        to
                        make the website mobile friendly.

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This was my first time using an API and I learned a lot about how to work with them effectively. I gained
                valuable experience in making API calls, handling responses, and integrating data into a web
                application.</p>
            <p>Some key takeaways include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>APIs are very powerful tools and very useful overall</li>
                <li>Effective communication mitigates a majority of issues that arise in group projects</li>
                <li>Understanding the importance of user experience and accessibility in web design</li>
                <li>Experience working with JavaScript and asynchronous programming</li>
            </ul>
