                <p>The biggest challenge I personally faced in this project was working and programming with a team. This
                    was something I had not done on this level before, and was an active point of conflict. This conflict
                    arose in three different areas: version control, implementation responsibilities, and design decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem regarding version control was that many of the team members were not familiar with Git and
                    GitHub. This led to many issues with merging and conflicts in the code. To solve this, we had
                    an initial training session on Git and GitHub, which helped to bring everyone up to speed. However,
                    merge conflicts still occurred, and we had to spend time resolving them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second problem was regarding implementation responsibilities. We used a ScrumBoard to assign tasks,
                    but some team members were not completing their tasks on time. Primarily the people responsible for the
                    tasks that must be completed before others. This led to delays in the project timeline and
                    increased pressure on other team members to pick up the slack. To address this, we tried to assign our
                    tasks in a way such that dependencies were minimized and everyone had a clear understanding of their
                    responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last problem was regarding design decisions. We had many discussions about the design of the
                    calculator, and there were disagreements about the best approach. Ultimately, we just let the person
                    responsible for the task make the decision, but this led to a very inconsistent design and codebase.

                <p>This project provided valuable experience in collaborative software development, emphasizing the
                    importance of clear communication and version control in team settings. It also reinforced my
                    understanding of Java programming and GUI design principles.</p>
                <p>Meeting shareholder and project demands required effective prioritization and time management skills.
                    Regular check-ins and updates ensured that all team members were aligned and that any issues were
                    addressed promptly.</p>
                <p>If I were to work on this same project again, I would do many things quite differently. For example, I
                    would prioritize communication and collaboration among team members to ensure everyone is on the same
                    page. In particular, I think the design of the codebase itself should've been much more of a frequent
                    topic of conversation among the team.</p>
                <p>Some key takeaways include:</p>
                <ul class="arrowed-list">
                    <li>Teamwork and collaboration are essential for successful project outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Effective communication helps to resolve conflicts and align team goals.</li>
                    <li>Version control systems like Git are invaluable for managing code changes in a team setting.</li>
                    <li>Working with JavaFX enhanced my skills in GUI development and user interface design.</li>
