                <p>At the time of making this, it was the biggest project I've ever worked on and designed on my own.
                    This
                    naturally came with a lot of unique challenges that I had not encountered yet. This project required
                    a lot of foresight into not only what I knew I wanted to build, but to try and make it easier to
                    adapt to new and different ideas that I could come up with. The way I designed this project was in
                    two stages. First I built the backend and the core. Once that was complete, I moved onto the
                    integration using Discord.py. Despite my best efforts, I still had issues where I was missing
                    something in my backend that I should've had implemented already. Many instances like this let me
                    value the planning that I did. While I encounted many issues of this kind, I am very very sure it
                    would've been a much bigger problem if I did not take the original efforts that I did to try and
                    plan ahead.</p>
                <p>One of the main challenges was designing a bot that could scale with the needs of the users. I had to
                    ensure that the bot could handle multiple servers and users without performance issues. One
                    particular performance struggle I was dealing with was originally I would save to a file and read on
                    every access, later I switched to having both saved to a JSON file as well as being cached in
                    memory. However, this led to it's own problems with there being mismatches between the cached data
                    and the saved data. This problem occurred when I would update the saved data but failed to properly
                    reflect that change in the cached data, leading to inconsistencies. I fixed this problem through the
                    use of a "Synchronizer" that ensured both the cached data and saved data were updated together.</p>
                <p>Additionally, a major challenge was getting the notification and problem delivery system to work.
                    Ultimately through the usage of the Observer pattern and some custom made buckets, I was able to
                    accurately notify users. The way I implemented this was adding to the buckets based on settings and
                    other parameters. Then I have a loop running that is constantly checking the time. On specific
                    times, I would search through the buckets and essentially notify each server with the type of
                    notification.</p>
                <p>Finally, I had to ensure that the bot was user-friendly and easy to use. I spent a lot of time
                    designing
                    the commands and interactions to be intuitive and straightforward. This included creating a help
                    command
                    that provided users with information on how to use the bot and its features. I also spent some time
                    developing a <a href="/pages/other/beastcode-help.html">Help & Setup Page</a>.</p>

                <p>This was an incredibly useful project for my development. Building this product allowed me to put
                    together everything I know and learned in a way that allowed me to apply my skills effectively. Not
                    only did I learn an enormous amount about building and maintaining a live service product, but I
                    also gained valuable experience in project management and design.</p>
                <p>I also realized how useful it is to have a solid understanding of the underlying technologies and
                    frameworks when building a complex system. Whenever I would have a problem, I would go refer to the
                    documentation.</p>
