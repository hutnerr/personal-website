            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Duke Shell (DukeSH) is a custom shell program designed to provide a user-friendly command-line
                interface for executing commands and managing processes. It was developed as part of a project to
                enhance understanding of processes and system calls.</p>
            <p>The shell supports various features, including command execution, process management, and built-in
                commands. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for educational purposes
                and as a foundation for further development.</p>
            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C Programming Language:</strong> Used for implementing the shell's core functionality and
                    system calls.</li>
                <li><strong>Makefile:</strong> Used for managing the build process and dependencies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This project was very valuable in teaching about the process lifecycle and system calls.</p>
            <p>Not only did it help me become a better C programmer, it's primary value to me was in how it deepened my
                understanding of operating system concepts.</p>
            <p>Some key takeaways include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding of process management and system calls.</li>
                <li>Importance of robust error handling in software development.</li>
                <li>Value of thorough testing and documentation.</li>
            </ul>
