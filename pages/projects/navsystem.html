                    <p>The Navigation System is a Java-based application designed to provide real-time GPS navigation
                        and mapping services.</p>
                    <p>It features a user-friendly interface that allows users to input destinations and receive
                        directions.</p>
                    <p>The system utilizes GPS satellite technology to track the user's location and provide accurate
                        navigation instructions.</p>
                    <p>It also includes features such as route-relocation.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="/resources/gifs/projects/navsys.gif">GIF</a> is a very simple demonstration of the system's capabilities in real-time navigation and mapping.</p>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>Going into this project, I knew nothing about the world of GPS technology and real-time navigation
                systems. I had to learn everything about this subject while also figuring out how to program it at the same time.</p>
            <p>The biggest challenge I faced was system optimization. A GPS system must process location data quickly
                and efficiently to provide real-time updates to users. I had to learn about algorithms for pathfinding
                and how to manage data from multiple sources.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <!-- design patterns, optimization matters, threading,  -->
            <p>This project taught me the importance of understanding both the hardware and software aspects of GPS technology. I learned how to effectively integrate these components to create a functional navigation system.</p>
            <p>Working on this project also improved my skills in Java programming, particularly in GUI development and
                real-time data processing. Threading was also a key aspect, as it allowed for smoother user interactions
                and more responsive updates.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I gained insights into design patterns that are crucial for building scalable and maintainable software. Understanding patterns such as Model-View-Controller (MVC), Observer, and Strategy helped me structure the application more effectively.</p>
            <p>Some key takeaways include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improving my skills in Java programming and GUI development.</li>
                <li>Understanding the systems behind navigation systems.</li>
                <li>Gaining experience in optimizing algorithms for efficient pathfinding and navigation.</li>
