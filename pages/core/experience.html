            <h3>Coding For Data Intern</h3>
            <h3>May 2024 - August 2024</h3>
            <p>Over the Summer of 2024, I was selected for the <a
                    href="https://www.credential.net/88229f7b-875f-4587-90cc-16f2fe5578b5#acc.oSP3I1yW">Global Career
                    Accelerator: Coding for Data
                    track</a>. This industry-focused program strengthened my skills in data analysis,
                particularly with tools like PostgreSQL and Python's Pandas library, ultimately earning me the <a
                    href="https://www.credential.net/1d8168a8-df4c-4180-a412-9d36ece8aa6a#acc.bt2EXd06">Python

                    href="https://www.credential.net/4f3405bd-57d1-445b-9e19-167647d2b420#acc.miy81F2I">SQL
                    Specialist</a>, and <a
                    href="https://www.credential.net/c66cab81-87c3-44e4-98da-2489798c9ea8#acc.hQrLAiXm">Intercultural
                    Skills</a> badges. The curriculum emphasized
                real-world data applications, and I gained hands-on experience working with datasets from major
                companies such as <a
                    href="https://www.credential.net/4dea0336-916c-49e5-8417-3bf571bbefd4#acc.CTiV2exs">Intel</a> and
                the <a href="https://www.credential.net/e8c09525-23de-494e-b2e1-0d82485d4d45#acc.iNVfJnAX">Grammys</a>.
            </p>
            <p>I developed a strong skillset regarding data. Skills involving collecting, cleaning,
                analyzing, and visualizing data. I used Tableau to create compelling visual stories and dashboards,
                which helped me learn how to communicate insights effectively. Each week included collaborative
                challenges and capstone-style projects that sharpened my data and team communication
                skills.</p>
            <p>By the end of the program, I had built several data solutions, learned many new skills, and gained
                confidence
                in my ability to tackle data-driven problems in real-world environments.</p>

            <h2>Wisetek Solutions</h2>
            <h3>ITAD Technician</h3>
            <h3>July 2021 - April 2023</h3>
            <p>While working in IT asset disposal, I gained hands-on experience with a variety of enterprise hardware,
                including servers, switches, desktops, and laptops. My role involved refurbishing and recycling
                equipment, testing components like RAM, and helping ensure hardware was ready for reuse or proper
                disposal. This gave me a practical understanding of the physical side of technology and how it supports
                larger systems.</p>
            <p>I also helped with training new team members, creating a basic onboarding routine and offering support
                when questions came up. Over time, I became a consistent resource for others in my section, which gave
                me the chance to develop clearer communication and team-focused problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>In addition to day-to-day tasks, I contributed to refining several workflows that were later adopted more
                widely across the warehouse. It was a collaborative environment where even small adjustments could have
                a meaningful impact, and it taught me the value of clear communication, teamwork, and
                systematic improvements.</p>

            <h2>Iron Mountain</h2>
            <h3>ITAD Technician</h3>
            <h3>May 2024 - March 2025</h3>
            <p>I was invited back to my previous role due to my experience, previous contributions, and
                work ethic. Returning gave me the opportunity to build on what I had already learned, with a
                focus on refining outdated processes and supporting the team through ongoing improvements. One of my
                main responsibilities was retraining an entire section, helping to reestablish clear workflows and
                improve day-to-day efficiency. During this time, Wisetek was acquired by Iron Mountain, which brought
                about structural changes and new expectations across the organization.</p>
            <p>I worked closely with teams made up of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, adapting to
                different working styles and communication needs. I also played a role in helping the team stay aligned
                with company quotas and timelines, contributing wherever possible to keep operations moving smoothly.
