                    <p>My first ever semester of college was at <a href="https://laurelridge.edu/">Laurel Ridge
                            Community College</a>.
                        When I started, I didn't have a great idea of who I was and what I wanted to do in my life.
                        However, it was here that I was first introduced to programming. The first course I took was CSC
                        221 which was a very simplified introduction to Python.
                        Back then, I didn't know the difference between a function and a class, and I would check
                        booleans by using equality to compare them to True or False.
                    </p>
                    <p>I graduated <a href="https://laurelridge.edu/">Laurel Ridge</a> with my Associate's Degree, and
                        with my newfound passion,
                        I transferred to <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/">James Madison University</a> to pursue a
                        Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
                        It's been about 2 years since I first transferred, and I've grown so much as a developer.
                        I've had the opportunity to work on some amazing projects, and I've learned from some incredible
                        professors.
                        I'm truly thankful for all the experiences I've had and the people I've met along the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today marks the first day of the Fall 2025 semester. It also marks my final semester at <a
                            href="https://www.jmu.edu/">James Madison University</a>.
                        It's been a long journey, and I can't believe it's almost over. I'm about to achieve one of my
                        main goals over the last couple of years of my life, graduating with my Bachelor's Degree in
                        Computer Science.
                        I'm excited to see what the future holds, and I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my
                        life.

            <div class="panelbg hero-text pspacing">
                <p>I've learned and grown a lot during my time at university. I've developed many projects both for
                    myself and for my classes. I've worked with many other students and have gained valuable experience
                    in teamwork and collaboration.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest projects I've completed was the <a
                        href="/pages/projects/united-calculator.html">unitED calculator</a>. This was my first time
                    using Git and GitHub within a team which turned out to be quite a headache at first, but we quickly
                    got it under control. I learned a whole ton about software development through this project as it
                    took place within an environment meant to simulate real-world software development. We developed
                    using an agile methodology and worked with a "stakeholder" to gather requirements and feedback.</p>
                <p>Another project I'm proud of is my <a href="/pages/projects/navsystem.html">Navigation System</a>.
                    This was another project that was developed for a class. This project required implementation of
                    various algorithms for pathfinding and navigation (such as Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford) which was
                    very rewarding to do. My favorite part of this project was changing my algorithm and seeing the very
                    visible changes in speed. It really helped me understand the importance of optimization and
                    efficiency in software development.</p>
                <p>Outside of projects I've made for school, my biggest project I've worked on yet has been my <a
                        href="/pages/projects/leetcode-bot.html">LeetCode Bot</a>. I put so much work into this, and
                    I've even <a href="https://top.gg/bot/1392738606120173719">released it to the public</a> and have
                    been actively maintaining it since its release. I took everything I learned from school and other
                    personal projects and turned them into something I could provide to the world! Taking this step of a
                    major personal project, it quickly helped me understand the value of working on things on your own.
                    There would be many times where the class would be learning about something that I already knew how
                    to do because I've done it for this project.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I've recently completed an entire game! <a href="/pages/games/forgotten-paths.html">Forgotten
                        Paths</a> is a puzzle game I made with a friend for the <a
                        href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">GMTK 2025 Game Jam</a>. As far as I know, this is the
                    biggest Game Jam ever at the time of this post, with over 9500 game submissions! Overall, we ranked
                    very well. Our best ranking was <strong>583rd</strong> in the Enjoyment category (The most important
                    one!). The biggest thing I learned from this jam was the importance of clean and scalable code. Game
                    Development is often wrought with scope creep. While this is a bad thing, if your game is coded to
                    allow extending systems and features, it becomes much easier to manage and add new content. If you
                    wanted to play the game, you can <a href="https://hutnerr.itch.io/forgotten-paths">find it here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>These projects have taught me a lot about software development and have helped me grow as a
                    programmer. I've learned how to develop scalable and maintainable systems, as well as how to work
                    effectively in a team.</p>

                <p>As of today, I still have plenty left to do to prepare for graduation. Not only do I have to make it
                    through these last couple months,
                    I also need to practice my coding skills and prepare for the job market. I plan to do this by
                    working on some more projects.
                    I have the bold plan to design and develop a complete project each month leading up to graduation.
                    Another way of practice is that I intend on doing daily <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>
                    problems
                    and participating in coding contests.</p>
                <p>Overall, I'm excited to see where my skills take me, and I'm looking forward to the challenges ahead!
