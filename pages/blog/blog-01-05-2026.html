                        Today marks the first Monday of the new year, naturally, we all know what that means. It's time to (truly) get back to work. 
                        And just because I'm saying that, does not mean I haven't been busy. I've done a couple of things over the holiday break that I'm excited to talk about.

                        <!-- massaquerade -->
                        The biggest thing I did was complete another Game Jam. This time we created 
                        <a href="/pages/games/massaquerade.html">Massaquerade</a>. It is a murder mystery game, but with the 
                        twist of you are the murderer. You're an assassin at a masquerade ball and must use dialogue and other hints
                        to detect who your target is. It was really fun to work on, and I feel like I learned a lot from doing it.

                        <!-- lospec bot -->
                        Another thing I made recently was a <a href="/pages/projects/lospec-bot.html">Lospec Discord Bot</a>.
                        It is a simple bot whose entire purpose is to relay the Lospec Dailies to a server. The goal behind this was to 
                        try and create an enviornment which would help me stay consistent and improve at pixel at (sounds similar to my <a href="/pages/projects/leetcode-bot.html">LeetCode bot!</a>)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <!-- conclusion -->
                        That's about it for this minor update though. I'm really looking forward to everything this new year has to hold.
                        It is going to be a lot of new beginnings for me, and I really hope I can stick to my goals and make the most of it.
                        We will see how it goes!
