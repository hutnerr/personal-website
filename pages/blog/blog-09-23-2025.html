                    If you've read my previous blog posts, you might notice a <a
                        href="/pages/blog/blog-06-02-2025.html">particular one</a>
                    talked about the "completion" of this website. Thus this blog post might come as a surprise. In my
                    <a href="/pages/blog/blog-08-20-2025.html">last blog post</a>, I made the bold statement of trying
                    to complete a project each month
                    during my final semester. And for the first month of the semester, I decided the best way to try and
                    start off this challenge was through
                    improving the website on which I intend to host and showcase these projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've had a couple of reasons for redoing the website. At the time of making the first iteration,
                    I had only written one other complete <a href="/pages/projects/pantry-panic.html">web app</a>, and
                    when
                    I made this website, I was still learning a lot about web development. By the end of the project, my
                    skills had far surpassed the
                    point I was at when I started. When I would go to make changes or add new features,
                    I would often find myself frustrated at how I had originally structured the site. I would also end
                    up spending time trying to
                    create band-aid solutions to problems that could have been avoided with a better structure. This led
                    to me being
                    constantly unsatisfied with the website as a whole. I knew I could create something that looked
                    better and was
                    more indicative of my skills as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I am much much happier with this new iteration of the website. It looks much cleaner and
                    more modern.
                    I also think the code is much more organized and easier to work with. I strongly believe I will
                    enjoy adding more pages
                    and have a much easier time doing so. Lastly, it is a much better representation of my skills as a
                    developer.
                    I am excited to continue adding more content to the site and to continue improving it over time.
