                    As of December 15th, 2025, I have officially graduated. 
                    Surprisingly, I don't have a ton to say about it. 
                    I'm mostly just happy to be done and excited for what's next.
                    With some new found free time, I'm looking forward to focusing on things I've put off for a while,
                    as well as spending time job hunting and preparing for the next chapter of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just because I'm out of school doesn't mean that I'm done learning though! Learning new technologies
                    is one of the big things I'm going to focus on in the coming months. I want to not only enrich my understanding
                    of things that I already know, but also branch out and learn new skills that I haven't had the chance to explore yet.
                    If all goes well, there will be some new projects and blog posts in the near future showcasing what I've learned.
                    Overall, I'm just really excited for the future and what it holds.
