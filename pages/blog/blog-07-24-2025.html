                    <p>I've participated in my first ever Game Jam! This has been something I've always wanted to do,
                        and I'm quite happy that I was finally able to take part in one. One of the main reasons that I
                        wanted to join was to just take a dive into the deep end of game development. I've dabbled a bit
                        with development for a while now, but had yet to make an actual game until now. Having a set
                        theme and deadline was a great way to push myself and see what I could create in a short amount
                        of time.</p>
                    <p>The <a href="https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2025">Kenny Game Jam 2025</a> was the perfect
                        opportunity for me to do this. One of restrictions of this game was that you could only use
                        premade <a href="https://kenney.nl/assets">Kenny Assets</a>. This turned out to be another great
                        way to learn game developement as it removed a lot of time that would've been used to create
                        unique assets.</p>
                    <p>The theme for the jam was "Power". This theme was very vague, but eventually we landed on an idea
                        for a Tower Defense game where you must manage your resource of "Power". Before this, we had
                        many ideas, but the limitations of the jam, namely the asset restrictions, prevented us from
                        creating some of our other ideas. One of our other ideas was a puzzle game where you had to use
                        various ways to move electrical power from one point to another.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I had a great time participating in this jam. I feel like I succeeded in my goal of
                        learning more about Game Development, and I am quite interested in making more games. The <a
                            href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">GMTK Game Jam</a> is about a week away now, and I'm
                        very excited to apply what I learned from this jam to that one.</p>

                    <p>For the jam, I teamed up with a <a href="https://github.com/Koborooski">friend</a> of mine. The
                        concept of our game is a Tower Defense game where you must manage your resource of "Power". This
                        "Power" is not only your health, but also a resource that your towers need to keep shooting down
                        enemies.</p>
                    <p>The name <strong>Solar Charged</strong> came from the source of your power, which is solar
                        energy. To tie into this theme, we implemented a weather system. While the enemies attack you at
                        night, the weather during the day determines how much power you will regenerate before you're
                        attacked again.</p>
                    <p>We made the game in the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Engine</a>. As stated in the
                        previous section, one of my goals was to learn more about Game Developement. One of the many
                        things I learned is that making games is hard. We worked for 35 out of the 48 total hours of
                        this jam, yet our game was still lacking some polish and key features. I truly respect all Game
                        Developers out there.</p>
                    <p>Despite this, I am quite proud of the what we accomplished for our first time making a game and
                        in such a restrictive format as well.</p>
                    <p>For anyone interested in playing the game, you can either check out it's <a
