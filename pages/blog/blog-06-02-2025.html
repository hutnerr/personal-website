                    <p>This blog post marks the completion of my personal website! I've been working on this project for several months, doing little bits at a time. Over this time, it has slowly grown and developed into what it is today. A large part of the reason it took so long to actually be complete is due to the struggle of balancing school, work, projects, and my personal life.</p>
                    <p>Despite the simplicity of the website, I am proud of the final product, and I believe it is a good place for me to show off my work. I feel like I've learned a lot about Web Development during this time, in particular, I believe it was an excellent way to strengthen my fundamental skills. I also feel like this an excellent learning experience in the way of UI/UX design.</p>
                    <p>My plan for the future of this website is for it to be a reflection of me over time. I want this website to grow and evolve as I do. I hope I am able to make this a living portfolio that showcases my skills and projects. In the future, the style, content, and features of the website will likely change. Despite that, at its core, it will always be a reflection of me and my work.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for reading this blog post, and I hope you enjoy the website! There is more to read about the website <a href="/pages/projects/portfolio-website.html">here</a>!</p>
