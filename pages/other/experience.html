                        particularly with tools like PostgreSQL and Python's Pandas library, ultimately earning me the <a

                        real-world data applications, and I gained hands-on experience working with datasets from major
                        companies such as <a

                    </p>
                    <p>I developed a strong skillset regarding data. Skills involving collecting, cleaning,
                        analyzing, and visualizing data. I used Tableau to create compelling visual stories and dashboards,
                        which helped me learn how to communicate insights effectively. Each week included collaborative
                        challenges and capstone-style projects that sharpened my data and team communication
                        skills.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the program, I had built several data solutions, learned many new skills, and gained confidence in my ability to tackle data-driven problems in real-world environments.</p>

                <p>While working in IT asset disposal, I gained hands-on experience with a variety of enterprise hardware,
                    including servers, switches, desktops, and laptops. My role involved refurbishing and recycling
                    equipment, testing components like RAM, and helping ensure hardware was ready for reuse or proper
                    disposal. This gave me a practical understanding of the physical side of technology and how it supports
                    larger systems.</p>
                <p>I also helped with training new team members, creating a basic onboarding routine and offering support
                    when questions came up. Over time, I became a consistent resource for others in my section, which gave
                    me the chance to develop clearer communication and team-focused problem-solving skills.</p>
                <p>In addition to day-to-day tasks, I contributed to refining several workflows that were later adopted more
                    widely across the warehouse. It was a collaborative environment where even small adjustments could have
                    a meaningful impact, and it taught me the value of clear communication, teamwork, and
                    systematic improvements.</p>

                    <p>I was invited back to my previous role due to my experience, previous contributions, and
                        work ethic. Returning gave me the opportunity to build on what I had already learned, with a
                        focus on refining outdated processes and supporting the team through ongoing improvements. One of my
                        main responsibilities was retraining an entire section, helping to reestablish clear workflows and
                        improve day-to-day efficiency. During this time, Wisetek was acquired by Iron Mountain, which brought
                        about structural changes and new expectations across the organization.</p>
                    <p>I worked closely with teams made up of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, adapting to
                        different working styles and communication needs. I also played a role in helping the team stay aligned
                        with company quotas and timelines, contributing wherever possible to keep operations moving smoothly.
