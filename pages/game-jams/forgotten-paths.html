                    <p>Forgotten paths is the second game that I made alongside a <a href="https://github.com/Koborooski">friend</a>, this time for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">GMTK 2025</a>. "Loop" was the theme for this jam. We incoroproated this through creating a puzzle game where you define a sequence of movement commands that constantly loop until the player is manually stopped or completes the puzzle. You can play the game directly though the embed below, or you can visit the <a href="https://hutnerr.itch.io/forgotten-paths">itch.io page</a>.</p>
                    <p>Once again I learned many things through making of this game with my partner. One of my main focuses during this jam was the UI design and implementation. It was difficult to try and make a UI that conveyed all of the information that was necessary while also being simple and easy to use and understand.</p>
                    <p>One thing I feel like we did a lot better this jam was adding in a lot of the essentials first before we started. This included simple things like a settings menu, a way to close the game, etc. Our last jam entry we didn't get to these in time and it made the game feel very unpolished and lacking. One of the reasons this worked is that it also gave us time to focus on and plan out our ideas and concepts before starting them. This approach of doing some of the non-gameplay impactful things worked great for us.</p>

                <div class="content-left">
                    <p>At it's core, the game is quite simple. You select a few movement commands and then click play. These will repeatedly loop until you either win or stop it manually. To complete a level, all of the enemies there must be slain.</p>
                    <p>Though it may sound easy, it get's pretty difficult! Especially on the levels that require rotations. Give it a chance! If you're truly stuck, there is a hints &amp; solutions cheat sheet on the <a href="https://hutnerr.itch.io/forgotten-paths">itch.io</a>.</p>
