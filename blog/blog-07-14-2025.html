            <h2>beast[code] Lives!</h2>
            <p>I'm very excited to announce that I've finally completed my LeetCode bot! It's been an extremely long time coming, but it has been such a rewarding process. This is a project I started working on about a year ago, got mostly finished, then dropped it. This was due to many reasons. Such as lack of time, scope creep, and the desire to make it perfect before releasing it to the public. These led me to putting it down for a long time until I decided to pick it back up about 2 months ago and restart entirely. </p>
            <p>Restarting entirely on the project was quite hard, but because of how far I got last time, I was able to know where I wanted to go, and how I wanted to design it. I had a clear vision in mind and was able to implement it much much more effectively this time around. One of the big things I changed was I took an Object Oriented approach. This allowed me to not only have a more modular design, but also to make sure of design patterns and other principles.</p>
            <p>Overall, I'm considerably happier with how it turned out this time around as opposed to my first time working on it. If you're curious about some of the more technical details, you can check out the <a href="/projectpages/leetcode-bot.html">project retrospective</a>.</p>
            <h2>What is beast[code]?</h2>
            <p>Now that you know some of the background of the bot, you might be wondering what it can really do? The best way I can describe it is that it facilitates coding practice within a Discord server. It does this through a system of customizable reoccurring problems, allowing users to practice and improve consistently alongside some friendly competition. It also has a rich notification system for various types of alerts such as contest reminders, daily problem alerts, and contest announcements.</p>
            <p>If you want to see a little more about what it can do, you can check out the <a href="/beastcode-help.html">Help & Setup Page</a>. This page features a full command list alongside more information about the bot itself. It also displays a setup tutorial which can be viewed to gain a better sense of the bot's capabilities.</p>
            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>One of the big questions I had to ask myself with this project, is where did I want it to end up? Ultimately, I envisioned this bot being a long term and sustained live service product. I want this bot to be something I keep up and running; something that is being actively worked on and maintained for it's users. While this is my first project that I'm releasing out to the world like this, I may find that this was a little ambitious, regardless, I'm excited to see where it goes!</p>
            <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I'm incredibly proud of what I've accomplished with beast[code]. It's been a challenging journey, but I've learned so much along the way. I'm excited to see how the bot evolves and grows with its users. Thank you for your support, and I hope you enjoy using beast[code] as much as I enjoyed creating it! Also, if you have any feedback, improvement ideas, or unsolveable problems, please send me an <a href="mailto:hunter.baker.b@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
