            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This is a Discord Bot created using <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Discord.py.</a>
                Its purpose is to facilitate LeetCoding within a Discord server. It achieves this goal through the usage
                of custom settings, customizable daily problems, notifications for upcoming contests, and other
                features.</p>
            <p>As a live service product, it is a constant work in progress and always changing. The source code is
                available on <a href="https://github.com/hutnerr/leetcode-bot">GitHub</a>. There you can also find an
                invite link and documentation for setting it up on your own server.</p>
            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> Discord.py, Requests</li>
                <li><strong>APIs:</strong> RESTful APIs, JSON</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Product</h2>
            <div class="grid-container">
                <div class="content-left">
                    <p>The final product was a Discord bot that helps users with LeetCode problems by providing
                        customizable daily challenges, tracking progress, and other things.</p>
                    <p>The bot is designed to be easily configurable, allowing server administrators to set their own
                        preferences for problem difficulty, frequency of these problems, and more.</p>
                    <p>The bot uses the LeetCode API to fetch problems and user data, ensuring that users receive relevant
                        content.</p>
                    <p>It also includes features such as reminders for upcoming contests, a leaderboard to track user
                        progress, and a help command to assist users in navigating the bot's features.</p>
                    <p>The image shows an example of a problem being sent to a user.</p>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>At the time of making this, it was the biggest project I've ever worked on and designed on my own. This
                naturally came with a lot of unique challenges that I had not encountered yet.</p>
            <p>One of the main challenges was designing a bot that could scale with the needs of the users. I had to
                ensure that the bot could handle multiple servers and users without performance issues.</p>
            <p>Another challenge was managing the custom settings and demands of each server. I used a combination of
                in-memory data structures and persistent storage to achieve this.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a major challenge was getting the notification and problem delivery system to work. Ultimately through the usage of the Observer pattern, namely a Time Observer, I was able to notify relevant users.</p>
            <p>Finally, I had to ensure that the bot was user-friendly and easy to use. I spent a lot of time designing
                the commands and interactions to be intuitive and straightforward. This included creating a help command
                that provided users with information on how to use the bot and its features.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>This was an incredibly useful project for my development. Building this product allowed me to put together everything I know and learned in a way that allowed me to apply my skills effectively. I learned an enormous amount about building and maintaining a live service product.</p>
            <p>I realized how useful it is to have a solid understanding of the underlying technologies and frameworks when building a complex system. Also how important it is to read the documentation of the libraries and tools I am using.</p>
            <p>Some key takeaways include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Documentation is an amazing resource to use</li>
                <li>Designing a scalable system</li>
                <li>Maintaining a live service product</li>
            </ul>
