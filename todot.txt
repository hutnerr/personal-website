- add the itch.io icons that link to the game to the game jams pages next to the header

- add in the metadata header stuff

- make all the hovers go back gently with something like below
    - transition: transform 0.3s ease;

- all images have the right alt text

- decide if i want the blue shadow blur on the element?

- hide the dots when the page gets small enough bc they conflict with the header

DOUBLE CHECKING
- ALL links work
- Each has the proper title at the top
- Has an icon at the top
- things have all the links they want
    - links to their github
    - links to their outsourced page (ie pantry panic)

- merge the branch and let this one be active

Update links to the website from outside sources
- linkedin posts
- beast[code] /help command (the actual code)
- top.gg
- itch.io profile 
- all github repos of the projects
