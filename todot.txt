1. make the navigation dots dynamic for the amount of sections i have in the page itself
2. make the project cards a link so i can click on it and it takes me to the page
    - have more specific links inside. like the github etc. 
3. text should have a background that makes it clearer
4. maybe get rid of the headshot image? make smaller?
5. https://formsubmit.co/
6. generalize the styles
7. make the js for the dots so that it scrapes the html and adds a dot and connects it 
    when it finds that specific class or type or whatever. 
8. clean up the css in general 
9. might still be worth adding in a contact page? maybe under other. add the form submit.
