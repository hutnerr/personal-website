DOUBLE CHECKING
- ALL links work
- Each has the proper title at the top
- Has an icon at the top
- things have all the links they want
    - links to their github
    - links to their outsourced page (ie pantry panic)
- The styles are proper. If it hovers, then it isn't jarring going back down.

- setup the email form thing
- text the metadata stuff my posting it in discord.
